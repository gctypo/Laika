*Regarding Industrial Foregoing:*

Industrial Foregoing is a tech mod that adds machines for automating otherwise difficult to automate tasks, such as mob spawning and grinding, farming, and enchanting. It is a continuation of Minefactory Reloaded. Most of these functions are possible through Thermal Expansion, though in most cases it requires significantly more infrastructure due to byproduct requirements. As this is a rather large feature overlap, this makes IF largely redundant. An exception to this overlap is mob spawning. If Industrial Foregoing is to be removed, I will likely need to include Soul Shards to replace it. Soul Shards is a mod that specializes in allowing the player to create their own mob spawners by killing many of a single mob type to power up a "soul shard", which is used to create an artificial, very powerful spawner. The mobs spawned must be killed by other means, such as Thermal Expansion's Centrifuge. While I recommend both mods, only one of them would fit in this pack in order to keep things straightforward. Including Industrial Foregoing would offer a number of interesting and fun to use machinery, but it would distract from the central focus on Thermal Expansion. Additionally, IF's spawning requires both power and a liquid to spawn mobs, so it is more balanced and requires additional setup. Soul Shards requires the player to grind numerous enemies, but its spawner functions completely free. While IF's spawning is more balanced, the additional setup required will be more difficult to understand.
